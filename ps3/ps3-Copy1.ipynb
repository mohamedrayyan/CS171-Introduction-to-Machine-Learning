    "## WRITE `nneval` and `trainneuralnet` [25 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: #000000;background-color: #FFFFEE\">\n",
    "This is the main portion of the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the $Y$ values are +1 and 0 (not +1 and -1).  This is as in class for neural networks and works better with a sigmoid output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write the two functions below (plus any more you would like to add to help): `nneval` and `trainneuralnet`.  The first takes an array/matrix of X vectors and the weights from a neural network and returns a vector of predicted Y values (should be numbers between 0 and 1 -- the probability of class +1, for each of the examples).  The second takes a data set (Xs and Ys), the number of hidden units, and the lambda value (for regularization), and returns the weights.  W1 are the weights from the input to the hidden and W2 are the weights from the hidden to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes:\n",
    "- **Starting Weights**: The code supplied randomly selects the weights near zero.  https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79 has a reasonable explanation of why we are doing it this way.  But for the purposes of the assignment, you can just accept this is a good way to initialize neural network weights.\n",
    "- **Offset Terms**: Each layer should have an \"offset\" or \"intercept\" unit (to supply a 1 to the next layer), except the output layer.\n",
    "- **Batch Updates**: For a problem this small, use batch updates.  That is, the step is based on the sum of the gradients for each data point in the training set.\n",
    "- **Step Size**: http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html#gradientdescentoptimizationalgorithms describes a number of methods to adaptively control $\\eta$ for fast convergence.  You don't need to understand any of them; however, without them, convergence to good solutions on this problem can be quite slow.  Therefore, *use RMSprop*: the code below has a simple version of RMSprop that is sufficient for this assignment.  You need to supply the code that calculates `sumofgrad2` which should be the sum of the square of each element of the gradient (the squared length of the gradient).  (for debugging, feel free to use a constant $\\eta$). \n",
    "- **Stopping Criterion**: To determine when to stop, check the loss function every 10 iterations.  If it has not improved by at least $10^{-6}$ over those 10 iterations, stop.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: You should penalize (from the regularization) all of the weights, even those coming out of offset units.  While it makes sense sometimes not to penalize the ones for the constant $1$ units, you'll find this easier if you just penalize them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips that might help:\n",
    "- Display the loss function's value every 10 iterations (or so).  It should be getting smaller.  If not, your gradient is not pointing in the right direction.\n",
    "- The smaller $\\lambda$ is and the more units, the more difficult (longer) the optimization will be.\n",
    "- Write a function to do forward propagation and one to do backward propagation.  Write a function to evaluate the loss function.  In general, break things up to keep things straight.\n",
    "- Processing the entire batch at once is more efficient in numpy.  Use numpy broadcasting to avoid loops where possible.\n",

    "The plot above measures the performance of a neural network in terms of hideen units and the value of lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more hidden units there are the more accurate the network is. This is due to more computation occuring to better approximate the function\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller lambda is the more accurate the network is. This is due to when lambda is smaller it would take a smaller step into the wrong direction (if it is going in the wrong direction)\n",

    "The part of this plot that agree with material taught in class is the smaller the lambda the better and the more hidden units there the better the network is.\n",
